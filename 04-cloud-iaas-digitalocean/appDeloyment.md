## 🌩️ Cloud & Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) — DigitalOcean Deployment

### 🚀 Overview  
In this module of my **TechWorld by Nana DevOps Bootcamp**, I learned about **Cloud & Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** and how to deploy applications on cloud servers.  
I used **DigitalOcean Droplets** to host and deploy a sample **Java + React application** that I built locally using **Gradle** inside **IntelliJ IDEA**.

### 🧠 What I Accomplished

#### 1️⃣ Created a Droplet on DigitalOcean
- Region: **London (LON1)** – best performance from Nigeria  
- Image: **Ubuntu 22.04 (Jammy Jellyfish)**  
- Authentication: **SSH key** (no password login)  

---

#### 2️⃣ Built the Java Application Locally
- Opened my Spring Boot project in IntelliJ and ran the Gradle build command:
  ```bash
  ./gradlew build
- The output ```.jar``` file was generated inside ``` build/libs/```
