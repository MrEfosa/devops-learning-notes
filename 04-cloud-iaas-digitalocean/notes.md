## 🧠 1️⃣ What is IaaS?

**Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)** provides virtualized computing resources over the internet.  
Instead of managing physical servers, you use cloud-based virtual machines (droplets) and other resources.

### 💡 Key Concepts:
| Concept | Description |
|----------|--------------|
| **Compute (Droplets)** | Virtual servers where you can deploy your apps. |
| **Storage (Volumes, Spaces)** | For persistent file and object storage. |
| **Networking** | Manage IPs, firewalls, load balancers, and private networks. |
| **Snapshots & Backups** | Save VM states and data for recovery or cloning. |
| **Scaling** | Easily add or remove compute power based on demand. |

## ⚙️ 2️⃣ Why DevOps Uses IaaS

IaaS is essential for DevOps because it allows you to:
- **Automate infrastructure provisioning** (with tools like Terraform or Ansible)
- **Deploy apps easily** to the cloud
- **Standardize environments** (same configuration in dev, staging, and production)
- **Scale** your application infrastructure on demand
