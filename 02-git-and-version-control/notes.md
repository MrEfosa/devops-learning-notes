📘 Module: Git and Version Control  

---

## 🧠 Summary

### What I Learned
In this module, I learned about **Git**, a version control system that helps developers track changes to files and collaborate on projects.  
I now understand what **repositories**, **commits**, **branches**, and **merges** are, and how **GitHub** is used to store and share code online.  

### Why It Matters
Version control is essential in DevOps because many engineers work on the same projects.  
Git keeps everything organized, prevents overwriting, and allows rollback when mistakes happen.  
It also connects directly with CI/CD tools like **Jenkins** and **GitHub Actions**.

### What I Practiced
- Installed Git and set up my user info.  
- Created a local repository using `git init`.  
- Added and committed files using `git add` and `git commit`.  
- Pushed changes to GitHub with `git push`.  
- Created and merged branches to test new features.
